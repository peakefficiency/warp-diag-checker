reply_by_issue_type:
  "Firewall":
    message: |
      There May be a Firewall or service blocking required ports or performing TSL inspection.
      Please verify all the required ports are unblocked https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/firewall/
  "VPN Application Found":
    message: |
      Warp can run alongside legacy VPN solutions provided the following requirements are met, and configuration changes are made which are listed in the [Legacy VPN compatibility documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/vpn/)
  "Port 53 Bound":
    message: |
      This indicates something else is bound to localhost port 53 and likely also
      trying to do DNS interception or run a local DNS proxy.
  "ROUTE":
    message: |
      A large number of route changes suggests that there is another application such as a third party VPN that is competing with the Warp client
  "Port Blocked":
    message: |
      This is a Linux permission configuration issue on the device and needs to be resolved by the customer.
      This means the UDP connection to the edge was established, but one of the steps afterward failed for lack of permissions.
      Typically this is because something in AppArmor or SELinux is denying a capability we need to operate, probably CAP_NET_ADMIN or CAP_NET_RAW.
      It can also happen if you are trying to run this in a Docker container and have not specified the correct permissions. Check `auditd` for denials.
      On Linux we use `setsockopt` to set SO_MARK on the UDP socket, which can fail on permissions. We can also be denied trying to open /dev/net/tun to create the tunnel device.
      We can also fail trying to send netlink commands to set kernel routing rules.
  "BADCERT":
    message: |
      Please visit zero-trust-client.cloudflareclient.com/v0/client_config in the browser and look at the certificate used to sign the HTTPS connection.
      Please verify https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/firewall/ for a list of domains, IPs and ports that must be excluded from Firewall or TLS inspection.
  "BYTES":
    message: |
      The not enough bytes error is fixed in version 2022.9.214.1
      Update to version post fix later than 2022.9.214.1 and verify whether issue persists.
  "BADVERSION":
    message: |
      It appears that you are running a version that has been flagged as a bad version due to issues that were not found in prerelease testing.
      This version has since been removed from the release site.
  "OUTDATED_VERSION":
    message: |
      It appears that you are not running the latest version of the chosen release train.
      Please attempt to replicate the error using the latest available version according to the details below.
  "SPLITTUNNEL":
    message: |
      The IP address assigned to the interface being used for the tunnel is not correctly excluded from the split tunnel configuration.
      Please ensure this IP address (or range) is added to the split tunnel configuration for the warp profile used by this device.
      More details can be found at: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/private-net/connect-private-networks/#3-route-private-network-ips-through-warp"
  "EXCLUDE_EDITED":
    message: |
      It appears that a change has been made to the default split tunnel exclusions list has been edited.
      We strongly advise against this as it can cause unintended issues and should only be done in the event that warp to tunnel routing is used.
      Only the smallest subset of IP addresses have been removed from the exclusion list.
      More details can be found at: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/private-net/connect-private-networks/#3-route-private-network-ips-through-warp"
  "OS Firewall":
    message: |
      It appears that the OS level firewall on the machine running warp is blocking access to our required endpoints.
      Please verify all the required ports are unblocked https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/firewall/
  "Certificate Install Restriction":
    message: |
      It appears that due to an OS restriction the automatic installation process of the Cloudflare Teams Certificate could not be completed in its entirety.
      The certificate should be installed but we were not able to mark it as trusted, this will need to be done manually.
      https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/install-cert-with-warp/#view-the-installed-certificate
      Please mark the certificate as trusted if it is not already.
  "Possible Revoked Device":
    message: |
      There is an indication that the device is being blocked by the Cloudflare edge due to the device being marked as revoked.
      Please verify whether the device has been revoked.
      If it has been revoked this device ID will be blocked as expected.
      To resolve this issue please unrevoke the device or uninstall and reinstall the warp client to register the device with a new `device ID`
